# NN Game Models Integration Complete

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

## Summary

Successfully integrated neural network game models into the prediction pipeline, replacing the previous Elo/Poisson system. All three core game models (TOTAL_GOALS, MONEYLINE, GOAL_DIFF) are now actively used in production predictions.

## What Changed

### Models Deployed

1. **TOTAL_GOALS** - Predicts total goals in a game
   - Replaced: Poisson total allocation
   - Validation RMSE: 2.298 (vs Poisson 2.361)
   
2. **MONEYLINE** - Predicts home team win probability
   - Replaced: Elo probability
   - Validation accuracy: 60.4% (vs Elo 51.5%)
   
3. **GOAL_DIFF** - Predicts score differential
   - Replaced: Poisson differential
   - Validation RMSE: 2.434 (vs Poisson 2.816)

### Integration Points

**File**: `nhl_betting/cli.py` (predict_core function)

**Changes**:
1. Load NN models at startup (lines ~700-740)
   - TOTAL_GOALS, MONEYLINE, GOAL_DIFF
   - Uses ONNX format for Windows compatibility
   - Graceful fallback to Elo/Poisson if unavailable

2. Compute features for NN (lines ~930-970)
   - 95-feature vectors (same as training)
   - Elo, recent form, rest days, season progress
   - Team encodings using abbreviations

3. Override predictions with NN (lines ~975-1010)
   - Moneyline: Use NN instead of Elo
   - Total goals: Use NN instead of Poisson
   - Goal differential: Use NN instead of Poisson differential
   - Subgroup adjustments applied AFTER NN predictions

4. Fallback behavior
   - If NN models not available → use Elo/Poisson
   - If NN prediction fails → use Elo/Poisson
   - Zero downtime deployment

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

- **Input**: 95 features
  - 13 base features (Elo, recent form, rest days, season progress)
  - 82 team encodings (one-hot for home/away teams)
- **Hidden Layers**: [128, 64, 32]
  - BatchNorm + Dropout(0.3) between layers
- **Output**:
  - TOTAL_GOALS: 1 value (regression)
  - MONEYLINE: 1 value (classification, probability)
  - GOAL_DIFF: 1 value (regression)
- **Training**: 3,136 games (Oct 2023 - Oct 2025)
- **Format**: ONNX (for NPU acceleration on Windows)

### DLL Import Order Fix

**Issue**: PyTorch/ONNX must load BEFORE pandas to avoid DLL conflicts  
**Solution**: 
```python
# CRITICAL: Import torch/onnx BEFORE pandas
try:
    import torch
    import onnxruntime
except (ImportError, OSError):
    pass  # Graceful fallback

import pandas as pd
```

**Status**: Implemented in:
- ✅ cli.py (lazy import with error handling)
- ✅ train_game_models.py (training script)
- ✅ backtest_nn_vs_elo.py (backtest script)
- ✅ validate_nn_game_models.py (validation script)

### Feature Engineering

**Matches training exactly** (95 features):

```python
game_features = {
    # Elo (3)
    "home_elo": elo.get(home),
    "away_elo": elo.get(away),
    "elo_diff": home_elo - away_elo,
    
    # Recent form (6)
    "home_goals_last10": ...,
    "home_goals_against_last10": ...,
    "home_wins_last10": ...,
    "away_goals_last10": ...,
    "away_goals_against_last10": ...,
    "away_wins_last10": ...,
    
    # Rest & season (3)
    "home_rest_days": ...,
    "away_rest_days": ...,
    "season_progress": games_played / 82.0,
    
    # Home indicator (1)
    "is_home": 1.0,
    
    # Team encodings (82)
    f"home_team_{home_abbr}": 1.0,
    f"away_team_{away_abbr}": 1.0,
}
```

   - Better for risk management
   
2. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Add win/loss to reconciliation
