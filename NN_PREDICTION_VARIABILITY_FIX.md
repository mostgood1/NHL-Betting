# Neural Network Prediction Variability - FIX COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Summary
User reported that NN period predictions were too uniform across teams - all games showing ~0.32-0.33 for first_10min regardless of team strength. There was no differentiation between strong offensive teams and weak teams.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Discovery Process
1. **Initial Investigation**: Checked prediction output → std=0.005774 (almost zero variation)
2. **Model Validation**: Verified models ARE trained correctly on 3,136 games with 95 features
3. **Feature Investigation**: Examined what features were being passed to predict()
4. **Critical Bug Found**: Only providing 3 of 95 expected features!

### The Bug
**File**: `nhl_betting/cli.py` lines 807-835

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```python
game_features = {
    "home_elo": elo.get(g.home),
    "away_elo": elo.get(g.away),
    "is_home": 1.0,
    # Add other features as needed by the model  # ← NEVER IMPLEMENTED!
}
```

**Issue**: Models trained on 95 features:
- ELO features (3): home_elo, away_elo, elo_diff
- Recent form (6): goals_last10, goals_against_last10, wins_last10 for both teams
- Rest days (2): home_rest_days, away_rest_days
- Season progress (1): games_played_season / 82
- Home indicator (1): is_home
- **Team encodings (82)**: one-hot vectors for all NHL teams

Prediction code only provided 3 features. Missing 92 features defaulted to 0.0, which after z-score normalization became large negative values. This caused all games to look identical to the model, producing uniform outputs.

### Secondary Bug
**Team Name Mismatch**: Even when team encodings were added, they used full names like "Detroit Red Wings" but models were trained with abbreviations like "DET". Result: team encodings still defaulted to 0.0!

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Load Historical Data for Feature Computation
```python
hist_path = RAW_DIR / "games_with_features.csv"
if hist_path.exists():
    historical_games_df = pd.read_csv(hist_path, parse_dates=["date"])
    # Build team state: last game date and games played
    for _, game in historical_games_df.iterrows():
        team_last_game[home_team] = game_date
        team_last_game[away_team] = game_date
        team_games_played[home_team] += 1
        team_games_played[away_team] += 1
```

### 2. Compute Recent Form Features
```python
def compute_recent_form_features(team, date, historical_df, window=10):
    """Compute recent form stats for a team before a given date."""
    # Get team's recent games before this date
    team_games = historical_df[
        ((historical_df["home"] == team) | (historical_df["away"] == team)) &
        (historical_df["date"] < date)
    ].tail(window)
    
    # Calculate goals for/against and wins
    # Returns: {goals_last10, goals_against_last10, wins_last10}
```

### 3. Build Complete Feature Vector
```python
# Convert to abbreviations for team encoding
home_abbr = get_team_assets(g.home).get("abbr").upper()  # "DET"
away_abbr = get_team_assets(g.away).get("abbr").upper()  # "TBL"

game_features = {
    # ELO (3 features)
    "home_elo": home_elo,
    "away_elo": away_elo,
    "elo_diff": home_elo - away_elo,
    
    # Recent form (6 features)
    "home_goals_last10": home_form["goals_last10"],
    "home_goals_against_last10": home_form["goals_against_last10"],
    "home_wins_last10": home_form["wins_last10"],
    "away_goals_last10": away_form["goals_last10"],
    "away_goals_against_last10": away_form["goals_against_last10"],
    "away_wins_last10": away_form["wins_last10"],
    
    # Rest days (2 features)
    "home_rest_days": float((game_date - team_last_game[g.home]).days),
    "away_rest_days": float((game_date - team_last_game[g.away]).days),
    
    # Season progress (1 feature)
    "season_progress": (home_gp + away_gp) / (2.0 * 82.0),
    
    # Home indicator (1 feature)
    "is_home": 1.0,
    
    # Team encodings (82 features) - CRITICAL: Use abbreviations!
    f"home_team_{home_abbr}": 1.0,  # "home_team_DET"
    f"away_team_{away_abbr}": 1.0,  # "away_team_TBL"
}
```

## Results

### Before Fix
```
Statistics:
  first_10min_proj std: 0.005774 (almost no variation!)
  Range: 0.32 - 0.33

All games looked the same:
  Detroit vs Tampa Bay:    0.33
  Washington vs Minnesota: 0.33
  Chicago vs Vancouver:    0.32
  Utah vs San Jose:        0.32
```

### After Fix
```
Statistics:
  first_10min_proj std: 0.038622 (7x MORE VARIABILITY!)
  Range: 0.29 - 0.38

Realistic team differentiation:
  Detroit vs Tampa Bay:    0.380  ← Both strong offensively (3.1, 3.4 goals/10)
  Washington vs Minnesota: 0.310  ← WSH strong defense (1.9 goals against/10)
  Chicago vs Vancouver:    0.330  ← Middle ground
  Utah vs San Jose:        0.290  ← Both struggling (2.3, 2.6 goals/10)
```

### Period Predictions Show Variation
```
Vancouver (strong offense):
  Period 1: 0.99, Period 2: 1.00, Period 3: 1.07
  Full game: 3.60 goals

San Jose (weak):
  Period 1: 0.79, Period 2: 0.84, Period 3: 0.85
  Full game: 0.90 goals
```

## Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
1. **Historical Data**: Uses `games_with_features.csv` (3,136 games)
2. **Recent Form**: Queries last 10 games per team before prediction date
3. **Rest Days**: Calculates days since last game from schedule
4. **Season Progress**: Tracks games_played / 82 for timing effects
5. **Team Identity**: One-hot encoding using 3-letter abbreviations

### Model Architecture
- **Input**: 95 features (13 base + 82 team encodings)
- **Hidden Layers**: [128, 64, 32]
- **Normalization**: Z-score using training data mean/std
- **Output**: 
  - FIRST_10MIN: Single value (total goals)
  - PERIOD_GOALS: 6 values (home/away for P1/P2/P3)

### Why Team Encodings Matter
Without team encodings, models can only differentiate based on ELO and recent form. But teams have unique playing styles:
- **Tampa Bay**: High-risk offensive system → more first-period goals
- **New Jersey**: Trap defense → lower scoring games
- **Colorado**: High-altitude advantage at home
- **Boston**: Bruins' defensive culture

Team encodings allow the model to learn these team-specific patterns from 3,136 historical games.
